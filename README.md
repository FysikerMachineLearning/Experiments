# Experiments
Repository for coming up with future projects or simply for messing around. Keep it clean though...

## For a new project idea...
1. Create a branch with a descriptive name
2. On this branch, create a folder in which all project files will be stored. *This will keep the master branch clean when you decide to merge your proposed project back into master*.
